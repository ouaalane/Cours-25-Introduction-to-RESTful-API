What are the main elements of RESTful API?
A REST API fundamentally relies on three major elements:

Client. The client is the software code or application that requests a resource from a server.
Server. The server is the software code or application that controls the resource and responds to client requests for the resource.
Resource. The resource is any data or content, such as text, video and images, the server controls and makes available in response to client requests.
